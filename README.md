### Exploration using topic modeling, nlp, visualizations and a recommender system to derive insights from data

## Data 

The data includes a variety of brands, products the brand sells, consumer reviews for products purchased, review title, number of upvotes and downvotes for a review, consumer nickname and consumer demographics data. 



## Some questions explored:

1. Understanding what about a brand resonates with consumers using their reviews (topic modeling)
2. Identifying a brands competitors (feature engineering driven methods and by buiilding a recomender engine)
3. Understanding on how the brand's performance over time has changed without any sales data
4. Investigating the performance of particular products over time
